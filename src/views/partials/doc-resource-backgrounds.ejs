<h2 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h2>
<p>
    Every story has a beginning. Your characterâ€™s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer,
    and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard
    could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a
    jester.
