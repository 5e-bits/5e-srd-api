<h2 id="ability-scores">Ability Scores</h2>
<p>
  Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability.
  An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s
  training and competence in activities related to that ability.
