<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>
  When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however,
  receive the class’s starting Equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re
  multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.
