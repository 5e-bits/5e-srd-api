  title: D&D 5e API
  description: "# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the dnd5eapi, the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition API!\nThis documentation should help you familiarize yourself with the resources\navailable and how to consume them with HTTP requests. Read through the getting\nstarted section before you dive in. Most of your problems should be solved\njust by reading through it.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nLet's make our first API request to the D&D 5th Edition API!\n\nOpen up a terminal and use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) or [httpie](http://httpie.org/)\nto make an API request for a resource. You can also scroll through the\ndefinitions below and send requests directly from the endpoint documentation!\n\nFor example, if you paste and run this `curl` command:\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/ability-scores/cha\" -H \"Accept: application/json\"\n```\n\nWe should see a result containing details about the Charisma ability score:\n```bash\n{\n  \"index\": \"cha\",\n  \"name\": \"CHA\",\n  \"full_name\": \"Charisma\",\n  \"desc\": [\n    \"Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It\n      includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent\n      a charming or commanding personality.\",\n    \"A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain\n      others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie,\n      or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception,\n      Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in\n      certain kinds of Charisma checks.\"\n  ],\n  \"skills\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Deception\",\n      \"index\": \"deception\",\n      \"url\": \"/api/skills/deception\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Intimidation\",\n      \"index\": \"intimidation\",\n      \"url\": \"/api/skills/intimidation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Performance\",\n      \"index\": \"performance\",\n      \"url\": \"/api/skills/performance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Persuasion\",\n      \"index\": \"persuasion\",\n      \"url\": \"/api/skills/persuasion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"url\": \"/api/ability-scores/cha\"\n}\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe dnd5eapi is a completely open API. No authentication is required to query\nand get data. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just\n`GET`-ing the data. If you find a mistake in the data, feel free to\n[message us](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7).\n\n## GraphQL\n\nThis API supports [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). The GraphQL URL for this API\nis `https://www.dnd5eapi.co/graphql`. Most of your questions regarding the GraphQL schema can be answered\nby querying the endpoint with the Apollo sandbox explorer.\n\n## Schemas\n\nDefinitions of all schemas will be accessible in a future update. Two of the most common schemas are described here.\n\n### `APIReference`\nRepresents a minimal representation of a resource. The detailed representation of the referenced resource can be retrieved by making a request to the referenced `URL`.\n```\nAPIReference {\n  index     string\n  name      string\n  url       string\n}\n```\n<hr>\n\n### `DC`\nRepresents a difficulty check.\n```\nDC {\n  dc_type       APIReference\n  dc_value      number\n  success_type  \"none\" | \"half\" | \"other\"\n}\n```\n<hr>\n\n### `Damage`\nRepresents damage.\n```\nDamage {\n  damage_type     APIReference\n  damage_dice     string\n}\n```\n<hr>\n\n### `Choice`\nRepresents a choice made by a player. Commonly seen related to decisions made during character creation or combat (e.g.: the description of the cleric class, under **Proficiencies**, states \"Skills: Choose two from\tHistory, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and\tReligion\" [[SRD p15]](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf#page=15))\n```\nChoice {\n  desc      string\n  choose    number\n  type      string\n  from      OptionSet\n}\n```\n<hr>\n\n### `OptionSet`\nThe OptionSet structure provides the options to be chosen from, or sufficient data to fetch and interpret the options. All OptionSets have an `option_set_type` attribute that indicates the structure of the object that contains the options. The possible values are `options_array`, `equipment_category`, and `reference_list`. Other attributes on the OptionSet depend on the value of this attribute.\n- `options_array`\n  - `options` (array): An array of Option objects. Each item in the array represents an option that can be chosen.\n- `equipment_category`\n  - `equipment_category` (APIReference): A reference to an EquipmentCategory. Each item in the EquipmentCategory's `equipment` array represents one option that can be chosen.\n- `resource_list`\n  - `resource_list_url` (string): A reference (by URL) to a collection in the database. The URL may include query parameters. Each item in the resulting ResourceList's `results` array represents one option that can be chosen.\n<hr>\n\n### `Option`\nWhen the options are given in an `options_array`, each item in the array inherits from the Option structure. All Options have an `option_type` attribute that indicates the structure of the option. The value of this attribute indicates how the option should be handled, and each type has different attributes. The possible values and their corresponding attributes are listed below.\n- `reference` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to a Document that can be added to the list of options chosen.\n  - `item` (APIReference): A reference to the chosen item.\n- `action` - A terminal option. Contains information describing an action, for use within Multiattack actions.\n  - `action_name` (string): The name of the action, according to its `name` attribute.\n  - `count` (number | string): The number of times this action can be repeated if this option is chosen.\n  - `type` (string = `\"melee\" | \"ranged\" | \"ability\" | \"magic\"`, optional): For attack actions that can be either melee, ranged, abilities, or magic.\n- `multiple` - When this option is chosen, all of its child options are chosen, and must be resolved the same way as a normal option.\n  - `items` (array): An array of Option objects. All of them must be taken if the option is chosen.\n- `choice` - A nested choice. If this option is chosen, the Choice structure contained within must be resolved like a normal Choice structure, and the results are the chosen options.\n  - `choice` (Choice): The Choice to resolve.\n- `string` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to a string.\n  - `string` (string): The string.\n- `ideal` - A terminal option. Contains information about an ideal.\n  - `desc` (string): A description of the ideal.\n  - `alignments` (ApiReference[]): A list of alignments of those who might follow the ideal.\n- `counted_reference` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to something else in the API along with a count.\n  - `count` (number): Count.\n  - `of` (ApiReference): Thing being referenced.\n- `score_prerequisite` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to an ability score and a minimum score.\n  - `ability_score` (ApiReference): Ability score being referenced.\n  - `minimum_score` (number): The minimum score required to satisfy the prerequisite.\n- `ability_bonus` - A terminal option. Contains a reference to an ability score and a bonus\n  - `ability_score` (ApiReference): Ability score being referenced\n  - `bonus` (number): The bonus being applied to the ability score\n- `breath` - A terminal option: Contains a reference to information about a breath attack.\n  - `name` (string): Name of the breath.\n  - `dc` (DC): Difficulty check of the breath attack.\n  - `damage` ([Damage]): Damage dealt by the breath attack, if any.\n- `damage` - A terminal option. Contains information about damage.\n  - `damage_type` (ApiReference): Reference to type of damage.\n  - `damage_dice` (string): Damage expressed in dice (e.g. \"13d6\").\n  - `notes` (string): Information regarding the damage.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What is the SRD?\nThe SRD, or Systems Reference Document, contains guidelines for publishing content under the OGL. This allows for some of the data for D&D 5e to be open source. The API only covers data that can be found in the SRD. [Here's a link to the full text of the SRD.](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)\n\n### What is the OGL?\nThe Open Game License (OGL) is a public copyright license by Wizards of the Coast that may be used by tabletop role-playing game developers to grant permission to modify, copy, and redistribute some of the content designed for their games, notably game mechanics. However, they must share-alike copies and derivative works. [More information about the OGL can be found here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License)\n\n### A monster, spell, subclass, etc. is missing from the API / Database. Can I add it?\nPlease check if the data is within the SRD. If it is, feel free to open an issue or PR to add it yourself. Otherwise, due to legal reasons, we cannot add it.\n\n### Can this API be self hosted?\nYes it can! You can also host the data yourself if you don't want to use the API at all. You can also make changes and add extra data if you like. However, it is up to you to merge in new changes to the data and API.\n\n#### Can I publish is on <insert platform>? Is this free use?\nYes, you can. The API itself is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), and the underlying data accessible via the API is supported under the SRD and OGL.\n\n# Status Page\n\nThe status page for the API can be found here: https://5e-bits.github.io/dnd-uptime/\n\n# Chat\n\nCome hang out with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7)!\n\n# Contribute\n\nThis API is built from two repositories.\n  - The repo containing the data lives here: https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-database\n  - The repo with the API implementation lives here: https://github.com/bagelbits/5e-srd-api\n\nThis is a evolving API and having fresh ideas are always welcome! You can\nopen an issue in either repo, open a PR for changes, or just discuss with\nother users in this discord.\n"

        # Alignment

        A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.[[SRD p58](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf#page=58)]

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. [[SRD p60](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf#page=60)]

        _Note:_ acolyte is the only background included in the SRD.

        # Class

        A character class is a fundamental part of the identity and nature of
        characters in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. A character's
        capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses are largely defined by its class.
        A character's class affects a character's available skills and abilities. [[SRD p8-55](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf#page=8)]

        effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such

        # Magic School

        Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of 
        magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, 
        believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it 
        derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.

                  ## Time

                  In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of **minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

                  In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.

                  For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.

                  Following the road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.

                  In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time.

                  # Using Ability Scores

                  Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:
                  - **Strength**, measuring physical power
                  - **Dexterity**, measuring agility
                  - **Constitution**, measuring endurance
                  - **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
                  - **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
                  - **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

                  Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.

                  The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

                  **Ability Scores and Modifiers** Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

                  A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.

                  Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.
