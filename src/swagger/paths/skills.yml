    # Skill

    Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a 
    character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific 
    aspect of an ability score, and an individualâ€™s proficiency in a skill 
    demonstrates a focus on that aspect.

              - Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a
                tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance
                on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call
                for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including
                dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.
