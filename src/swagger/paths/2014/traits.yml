              - Elves do not need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious,
                for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating,
                you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have
                become reflexive through years of practice. After resting this way, you gain the
                same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
