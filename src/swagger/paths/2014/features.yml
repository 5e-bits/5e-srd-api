    # Feature

    When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level.
    You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting Equipment, and a few
    features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity,
    Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

              - Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.
                On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and
                a possible bonus action.
              - Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use
                it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once
                on the same turn.
