              - You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only
                if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon,
                you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case,
                or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed
                weapon).
              - At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking
                a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition
                property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see
                "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage
                when used in this way.
