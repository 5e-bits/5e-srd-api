    # Equipment

    Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more
    in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and
    trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you
    can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.
