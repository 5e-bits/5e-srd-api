            example:
              index: elf
              name: Elf
              url: '/api/2014/races/elf'

                    name: DEX

              age: Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven
                understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience.
                An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can
                live to be 750 years old.
              alignment: Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly
                toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well
                as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception;
                their exile has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.
              language_desc: You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid,
                with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied,
                and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language
                so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
