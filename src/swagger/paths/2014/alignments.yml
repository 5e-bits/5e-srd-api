    # Alignment

    A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.[[SRD p58](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf#page=58)]
