    # Condition

    A condition alters a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can
    arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other
    effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such
    as invisible, can be advantageous.

                have disadvantage."
